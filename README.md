# Notes_Manager
The solution consists of 8 python files, 6 of which are presented as classes.
The main part of it includes Notes manager, user interface class and Notes class. They are designed to gather Notes as instances of class Note using user interface, which accepts input from the user and then proceed it with the Notes manager to either add, change or delete notes.
The supplementary part provides additional features, like gathering statistics of Notes stored (stats class), ID generator class and two other classes: for back up data to *.txt file and recovering from the same *txt file.
